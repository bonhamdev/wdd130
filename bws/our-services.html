        <img src="images/design-service.png" alt="">
        <p>Our design services are focused on a mobile-first methodology. That means that we will create layouts that work firstly on your phone. From there we will create responsive layout changes as the size of the screen increases, all the way to a widescreen desktop view.</p>

        <img src="images/content-service.png" alt="">
        <p>Content on the web is crucial for many reasons. Customers need a reason to choose you over someone else in your field. We do a competitive analysis with you so we can create content that fits your needs and communicates your services adequately to your audience. Content also plays an important role in any marketing efforts you may have.</p>
