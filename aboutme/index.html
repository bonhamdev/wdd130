<p>Hi everyone, I am from Arizona. My wife Rosana is from Brazil and we have three children. I also served my mission in Sao Paulo, Brazil. I am a software engineer without a degree so that is why I am here. I love programming and am looking forward to finishing my degree in Software Development. I am looking forward to working with all of you.</p>
